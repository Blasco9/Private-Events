> The purpose of this project was to learn about associations in rails

For this project I created a web page that lets users create events and invite other users to them. A user can only attend an event if he/she is invited first. See full task [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations#project-private-events)
